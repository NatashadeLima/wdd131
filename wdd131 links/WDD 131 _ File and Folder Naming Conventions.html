    <h2>File and Folder Naming Conventions</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>When working on the web, there are numerous things that affect the operation of the
      files, such as the browser, the protocol(s), the operating system, the language(s), etc. While
      many of these are out of your control, you can keep your work consistent and manageable through standard file and
      folder naming conventions.</p>
    <div class="callout info">
      <p>
        "When you're building a website, you need to assemble these files into a sensible structure on
        your local computer, make sure they can talk to one another, and get all your content looking
        right before you eventually upload them to a server." - MDN <span class="smaller">(Mozilla Developer Network
          Reference)</span>
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Prepare</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The file and folder naming conventions will be considered 'best-practice' rules for this
        course. These rules should be applied to all files and folders created in your course work.
        <div class="callout info">
          <p><em>Note that most organizations have their own file management guidelines and best
              practices, including conventions for naming files, folders, and other workflows. These conventions may
              vary
              from one organization to another.</em>
          </p>
          <p>Here are some <a href="../resources/naming-conventions.html">naming conventions</a> found in legacy
            programming.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>Review: <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dealing With Files</a> - MDN</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
    <p>You will be expected to follow these naming conventions throughout the course.</p>
    <ul class="check">
      <li>Use all <strong>lowercase</strong> syntax, e.g., <code>products.html</code>
        <div class="callout info">
          <p>
            Platforms and systems handle case sensitivity differently. Case
            sensitivity is an important concept to understand when managing files and folders.
          </p>
        </div>

      </li>
      <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use <strong>spaces</strong> in file and folder names. Use hyphens instead, e.g.,
        <code>design-document.html</code>
        <div class="callout info">
          <p> Spaces are handled inconsistently by user agents so do not use them. The Hypertext
            Transfer Protocol (HTTP) ignores spaces, except in file names. In file names, it replaces a space with this
            syntax: "<code>%20</code>" which syntax is confusing. Avoid using spaces and instead, if you want to create
            visual space, use hyphens.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> use <strong>special characters</strong>, e.g.,
        <code>&lt;,&gt;, \, /, #, ?, !</code>
        <div class="callout info">
          <p>
            Special characters often mean specific things to computers, so just avoid using them
            completely in the naming of files and folders.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>File and folder names should be as short and meaningful (<strong>semantic</strong>) as possible, e.g.,
        <code>winter-scene-sm.png</code> vs.
        <code>image13-v123523brokenbranchlifeimagery w200x200.png</code>
        <div class="callout info">
          <p>Short names save you, other developers, and site visitors from having to remember long complicated names
            for files and folders. When meaningful, names can also help predict the purpose or nature of the file or
            folder contents.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>In this class, the <strong>standard folder names</strong> for our sites/sub-folders are:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>styles</strong> - Folders with this name contain CSS files.</li>
          <li><strong>images</strong> - Folders with this name contain images.</li>
          <li><strong>scripts</strong> - Folders with this name contain JavaScript files.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

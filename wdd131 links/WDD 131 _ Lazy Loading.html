    <h2>Lazy Loading</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In terms of site performance and search engine optimization, our document loading goal is to
      be ready for action in a few seconds upon a request by the user. The issue is that we have
      many
      requests and payloads within a document itself, including images, that increase the load time
      to much more than the ideal target. The goal of this activity is to alleviate some of the load
      time by waiting until the page assets are actually needed by the user as they scroll. We
      introduce
      the design pattern of <strong>progressive loading or 'lazy-loading'</strong> of images.</p>

      <p><strong>First Meaningful Paint</strong><br>"It's important to
        deliver something
        meaningful to
        the user as soon as possible &mdash; the longer they wait for the page to load, the bigger
        the
        chance they will leave before waiting for everything to finish. We should be able to show
        them
        at least the basic view of the page they want to see, with placeholders in the places more
        content will eventually be loaded. This could be achieved by progressive loading &mdash;
        also
        known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading">Lazy loading</a>. This is all
        about deferring loading of as many resources as possible (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and only
        loading those immediately that are really needed for the very first
        experience." - MDN web docs</p>
    </div>



    <h3>Prepare</h3>
    <p>The objective is to load pages faster and one way to do that is to provide only the essential
      content to the client/user as the content is requested through events such as scrolling down a
      page or through navigation. Native or browser-level lazy loading has evolved to be a built-in
      attribute that can be applied to select elements such as images.</p>
    <pre><code class="html">&lt;img src="images/anyphoto.jpg" alt="A good description of the non decorative image" loading="lazy" width="300" height="500"&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The loading attribute has only two states, lazy and eager. The eager value instructs the
      browser
      to render the resource immediately and is the default. The lazy attribute will defer loading
      the
      element, such as an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, until the element
      is called into view by some user action, such as scrolling.</p>
    <div class="callout info">
      <p>"Lazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load
        these
        only when needed. It's a way to shorten the length of the <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path">critical
          rendering path</a>, which translates into reduced page load times. Lazy loading can occur
        on
        different moments in the application, but it typically happens on some user interactions
        such as
        scrolling and navigation." - MDN</p>

    <h3>Activity Instructions</h3>
    <p>Build a small page with multiple images to scroll through as they are stacked on top of each
      other on a single page. When testing the page in a browser, the images will only load until
      they
      come into view. This is difficult to notice without carefully scrolling and viewing the
      network
      tab loading information in Dev Tools. Here is an example:</p>
    <div class="callout info"> <a class="inline_disabled"
        href="https://web.dev/articles/browser-level-image-lazy-loading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demonstration of
        browser-level lazy loading support.</a>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>In VS Code, go to your course wdd131 repo and create a new HTML page named
        "<strong>lazyload.html</strong>" in a "<strong>week04</strong>" sub folder of wdd131.</li>
      <li>Support this new page with an external CSS and a JavaScript file that are each stored in
        their appropriately named folders within the folder.</li>
      <li>The lazyload.html page should have a standard <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and a
        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and the body
        should have a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and
        <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>.
      </li>
      <li>The header should contain a page title in an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element.</li>
      <li>The main section contains six (6) <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> child elements</li>
      <li>The footer can contain whatever you think appropriate along with the date that the
        document was last modified using JavaScript.</li>
      <li>The images dimensions must be 400px width by 600px+ height (portrait layouts).<br>Use
        your own images or <a href="https://www.thepaulcushing.com/image-placeholders-in-web-design-and-development/"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener">external placeholders</a>.</li>
      <li>Display the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements in one column down the center of the
        page regardless of the screen size. (HINT: CSS display:block)</li>
      <li>Correctly apply native lazy loading to the images so that they only load when the user
        scrolls down the page.</li>
      <li>Add a fade from black animation to each image using CSS animation and opacity.</li>

Website Project Subject

My website project will focus on volleyball. The site will include 
information about the rules of the game, player positions, strategies, 
and tips for improving skills. It will also highlight famous players 
and teams and feature a section for beginners to learn the basics.

I chose this topic because volleyball is a hobby I am passionate 
about, and I want to share this enthusiasm with others while 
promoting the sport. This project allows me to combine my love 
for volleyball with my technical skills in web development, 
creating a platform to engage and inform a wider audience.
